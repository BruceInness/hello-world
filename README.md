tutorial piece
I am Bruce and I am a powerlifter, personal trainer, comic book and muscle car loving goof ball that is new to learning code. I am focusing on Ruby and Rails because I need to make a new life for myself. This is very important for me and has not been easy, but I'm getting there, albeit slowly.
